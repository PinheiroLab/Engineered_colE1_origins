Raw data files are labelled as follows:

YYYYMMDD origins number antibiotics

*YYYYMMDD* is the date the experiment was carried out
*origin* of replication refers to wild-type (wt) or alpha (a)
*number* is the technical replicate of the experiment
*antibiotics* refer to whether kanamycin alone (-) or kanamycin and chloramphenicol (+) were used on the plate

Where possible technical replicate #1 was used in the preparation of the figure.
